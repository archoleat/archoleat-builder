## Getting Started

You can use this repository as a template to quickly create your project.

Below you will learn how to get started with **conqueror**
and what features it has.

### Prerequisites

For **conqueror** to work properly, you need the following programs:

-   **Node.js**
-   **Git**
-   **IDE or Code Editor**

<!-- ## ArchUI

This project uses the [**ArchUI**](https://github.com/Conqueror-Site-Builder/arch-ui)
library, so there is no need to create files like reset.scss, typography.scss,
mixins.scss, etc. only if you don't have your own developments. -->

<!-- > [!TIP]
> For more comfortable work with the library you can download
> [**Conqueror Helpers**](https://github.com/Conqueror-Site-Builder/conqueror-helpers). -->

## Awesome Browser Testing

[**Browtest**](https://github.com/Conqueror-Site-Builder/browtest)
is an application for testing in (**WebKit**) Safari, (**Gecko**) Firefox and
(**Chromium**) Edge and Chrome, will allow you to quickly and easily view
the site in all the necessary browsers, also it will be a salvation for
those who do not have the opportunity to buy Apple products.
